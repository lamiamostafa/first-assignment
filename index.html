            <p>Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your funders and
                partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have the
                knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation.Without a clear system of high-quality
                training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not sustain. Great staff could leave. Your
                program wonâ€™t reach as many young people as it could.</p>
